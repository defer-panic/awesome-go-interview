## How to add an item to the list
Open a pull request against the README.md document that adds the repository to the list.

- The pull request should add one and only one item to the list;
- The added item should be in alphabetical order within its category;
- The link should be the name of the package or project;
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional;
- Descriptions should follow the link on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
Remember to put a period . at the end of the project description;
- If you are creating a new category, move the projects that apply to the new category, ensuring that the resulting list has at least 3 projects in every category, and that the categories are alphabetized.

Fill out the template in your PR with the links asked for. If you accidentally remove the PR template from the submission, you can find it [here](https://github.com/defer-panic/awesome-go-interview/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
